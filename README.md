# PIC-10C-Project-1
This Program is an implementation of the game 'siete y medio'. 

# The Rules of the Game
The goal of the game is to get cards whose total value comes the closest to 7 1/2 without going over it. At each round of play the player places a bet. After that, the player and the dealer each draw one card from the deck.The player is then repeatedly asked if another card is wanted. The player can continue to draw cards while the total is less than 7 1/2. After the player's turn is over, the dealer's cards are shown. The dealer's play is always the same: the dealer continues to draw cards only if the total is less than 5 1/2.

# How to Play
After the program is started, the program will first ask the gamer which bet to take. After the gamer enters the bet, one random card will be distributed to the gamer and be printed on the console. Then the program is going to ask if anther card is wanted. The gamer can input 'y' for yes and 'n' for no. Then a card will be randomly assigned to the dealer and shown on the console. Then one new card will be sent to the dealer, and another new card will be given to the gamer. If the gamer chooose to stop getting card, the console will show all of the cards from the dealer and announce the winnder.
